Hi Joe, sorry this is so late, I'll be working hard to catch up for the remainder of the term.

This turned out to big a huge project for me, as I knew it would be, but was a necessary learning experience.

I tried to make the content user friendly for people who know nothing about Smash.


Issues:

I couldn't get my sidebars to display how I wanted them inline with the main section of the site.

I couldn't get the responsive images to work, I don't know what I did wrong here :/


Besides that, I'm very happy with how this came out. I think I emulated the official Smashbros websites to the best of my
ability right now. Those sites are linked to in my footer on the page. I made great progress. Now I have a lot of reading to 
do, and many more assignments.

Thanks,

Charles Dearing
