   <h1> Miss Baker <br><br></h1>

        <h2> First Lady of Space </h2>
            
            <p> Before humans were launched into space, many animals were propelled heavenwards to pave the way for mankind's 
                pioneering endeavors. These original pioneers, including numerous monkeys, served their nations in order to 
                investigate the biological effects of space travel. Perhaps the most famous animal astronaut is <em>Laika</em>, 
                the Soviet space dog who made her historic flight on <em>November 3, 1957</em>. The United States preferred to 
                use monkeys for its missions and launched numerous monkey flights primarily between <em>1948</em> and 
                <em>1961</em> paving the way for manned missions. Thirty-two monkeys flew in the space program; each had only 
                one mission. Numerous back-up monkeys also went through the programs but never flew. Monkeys from several 
                species were used including Rhesus Monkeys, Cynomolgus Monkeys, Squirrel Monkeys, and Pig-Tailed Macaques.
            </p>            
            
        <h2> Miss Baker's Historic Flight </h2> 
            
            <p><em>Miss Baker</em> and fellow female pioneer <em>Able's</em> historic flight on <em>May 28, 1959</em> 
                proved a turning point in the US space era. The first beings ever to be recovered alive from a flight into 
                outer space, their journey paved the way for putting the first man into orbit around the earth.

            <p>Miss Baker's journey lasted 15 minutes and reached speeds of up to 10,000 MPH. Baker and Able were weightless 
                for nine minutes. A NASA spokesperson stated that the monkeys were in "perfect condition" on their return to 
                earth. Indeed Miss Baker went on to live a long and fruitful life, living until 1984.
                Miss Baker and Able's journey gripped the world's imagination. Appearing on the <em>June 15, 1959</em> cover 
                of <em>Life</em> magazine the pair joined a growing list of women celebrities to grace the magazine's cover in 
                1959, a list which included <em>Marilyn Monroe</em>, <em>Zsa Zsa Gabor</em> and <em>Jackie Kennedy</em>.
            </p>
            
        <h2> The Mission </h2>
            
            <p>Miss Baker's flight aboard a <em>Jupiter AM-18 IRBM</em> (Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile) was another 
                milestone in the history of space flight, proving that life could be sustained in space. During the period 
                of weightlessness along the flight's trajectory arc, the physiological responses of Baker approached normal. 
                According to telemetry data, Baker even appeared to doze or become drowsy. Upon reentry, however, the 
                responses of both monkeys rose again, with the animals nearing a settled physiological state at landing.
                The Jupiter missile was originally developed by the US Army as a long-range successor to its <em>PGM-11 Redstone</em>
                 missile, but was eventually taken over and deployed by the <em>USAF</em> for political reasons. It was also 
                 the only one of the United States' early strategic ballistic missiles with some mobility.

        <h2> The US Space Program </h2>
            
            <p><em>President Eisenhower</em> formed the <em>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</em> (NASA) in 1958 
                with it's mission to encourage peaceful applications in space science. The agency became operational on 
                <em>October 1, 1958</em>. In the beginning, NASAâ€™s missions focused on the space race with the Soviet Union. 
                Following Soviet cosmonaut <em>Yuri Gagarin</em> becoming the first man to orbit the Earth in <em>1961</em>, 
                <em>President Kennedy</em> understood the need for America to surpass the Soviet Union in the space race. He 
                secured additional funding and resources from congress which allowed <em>John Glenn Jr.</em> to become the 
                first American to orbit Earth. Space exploration continued throughout the 1960s. Project Gemini and The 
                Apollo Program were the next projects carried out by NASA. On <em>July 20, 1969</em>, the Apollo 11 astronauts
                 <em>Neil Armstrong</em>, <em>Michael Collins</em>, and <em>Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin Jr.</em> realized President 
                 Kennedy's dream of landing a man on the moon. Currently, NASA is supporting the <em>International Space Station</em>
                  and is conducting in-depth surveys and scientific research throughout the solar system.

        <h2> Life in Retirement </h2>
            
            <p>Miss Baker married her long-time partner and fellow monkey <em>'Big George'</em> in <em>1962</em> at the Naval 
                Aerospace Medical Center in Pensacola, Florida where she lived. In 1971, Miss Baker was moved to the U.S. 
                Space & Rocket Center. Whilst there she received around 100 letters a day from schoolchildren and regularly 
                entertained visitors to the museum. Miss Bakers husband Big George passed away on <em>January 8, 1979</em>.
                 Not one to wait around for long, it was only three months until she 'married' again, this time to <em>Norman</em>, 
                 from the Yerkes National Primate Research Center. However, it seems Miss Baker wasn't entirely comfortable with 
                 the event after refusing to wear her white wedding train, tearing it off after a few seconds.
            </p>
                        
            <p>Norman and Miss Baker celebrated her birthday on the anniversary of her flight each year. To celebrate the 25th 
                anniversary of her flight, Miss Baker was treated to a rubber duck and, her favorite, strawberry gelatin with 
                bananas, along with well-wishes from thousands of people. <em>Miss Baker died aged 27</em>, of kidney failure 
                at a clinic at Auburn University after becoming the oldest living squirrel monkey on record. She is buried on 
                the grounds at the <em>U.S. Space & Rocket Center</em> and to this day her grave regularly has one or more 
                bananas on top.<br><br>
